    <h2>
    The Frame
    </h2>
	<p>
	  The bike frame is the main part of a bike; where all of the components are connected to.
	  They come in many types and sizes, depending on the purpose of the bike. There are frames 
	  for mountain bikes, road bikes, track bikes, fixed gear bikes, cyclocross bikes, and more. 
      All of these kinds of bike frames generally share the same pricipal in design: they are two 
	  triangles that form a truss.

	<p>
	Like all components for a bike, bike frames can be made with different materials. The most 
	common these days are made from aluminum; specifically from 6061 aluminum alloy. Due to its
	vast availability, relatively low pricepoint, its lower weight, and higher tensile strength 
	and lower ductility relative to steel, it is used frequently in modern bikes.
	</p>
	<p>
	Another common material for bicycle frame manufacturers to use is steel and carbon fiber.
	Less common materials that are used include titanium and graphene. Steel is used less often 
	today due to its higher weight, but boutique bike frame makers or custom frames will often 
	utilize steel due to its highly ductile properties to create custom shapes and sizes. Some
	manufacturers will also use titanium or carbon fiber for custom made bikes as well.
	</p>
	<p>
	The most prevalent material used in amateur and professional race bikes is carbon fiber. It's
	often used for high-end race bikes due to the intricate tube shapes carbon fiber layup can be
	used to create. Since thses bikes require certain properties such as being aerodynamically 
	optimied for speed, higher stffness, vibration absorption, and comfort, carbon fiber is used.

    <h2>
    The Drivetrain/Groupset
    </h2>
	<p>
	The drivetrain is composed of parts that allow the rider to move the bike. These include the 
	pedals, cranks, chainrings, chain, front derailleur, cassette, and rear derailleur. The front 
	and rear derailleurs shift the chain into different gears. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Included in the groupset of a bike are the shifters and brake calipers. The shifters are used by the 
	rider to shift between different gears. Sometimes the shifter will operate as both the shifter and the 
	brake lever in the same shifter. This is usually the case for road, cyclocross, and triathlon bikes.
	The shifters can be operated mechanically with a cable, or electronically. Both methods use shift levers.

    <h2>
    Wheels
    </h2>
	<p>
	Similar to bike frames, bike wheels also come in different shapes, sizes and materials with 
	different purposes. The two main materials bicycle wheels are made from are aluminum alloy
	and carbon fiber. Aluminum wheels are often more heavy and less aerodynamic, while carbon fiber
	wheels are often lighter and faster. The most common cross sections for aluminum wheels 
	are box sections, v-sections, and toroidalally shaped wheels. The most common shapes for carbon
	fiber wheels are the v-section and toroidal design. Box section wheels are usually more comfortable 
	and lively feeling, while v-section wheels are stiffer and faster. Toroidal wheels take the best of
	both wheels and are designed to be comfortable and maintain stiffness to sustain heavy torques and 
	be optimized aerodynamically.
