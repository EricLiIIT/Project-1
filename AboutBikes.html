  The Frame
  </h2>
	<p>
	The bike frame is the main part of a bike; where all of the components are connected to.
	They come in many types and sizes, depending on the purpose of the bike. There are frames 
	for mountain bikes, road bikes, track bikes, fixed gear bikes, cyclocross bikes, and more. 
	All of these kinds of bike frames generally share the same pricipal in design: they are two 
	triangles that form a truss. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Like all components for a bike, bike frames can be made with different materials. The most 
	common these days are made from aluminum; specifically from 6061 aluminum alloy. Due to its
	vast availability, relatively low pricepoint, its lower weight, and higher tensile strength 
	and lower ductility relative to steel, it is used frequently in modern bikes.
	</p>
	<p>
	Another common material for bicycle frame manufacturers to use is steel and carbon fiber.
	Less common materials that are used include titanium and graphene.
