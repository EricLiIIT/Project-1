  My dog, Lottie
  </h1>
  
  <p>
  My dog is a pitbull-labrador mixed dog. We adopted her 5 years ago when she was a 
  puppy from the Anti-Cruelty Society in Chicago.

  She is an energetic dog and loves to play fetch. She's difficult to be 
  introduced to but she is very affectionate once she is.

  She's a very curious dog, and loves to meet new animals.
